File name corrected successfully.

This task helps you understand how Git handles corrections when mistakes occur during file commits and pushes. You will intentionally make an error in a file name, fix it, and push the corrected version again. Create a new repository on GitHub named GitLabTask and clone it to your local computer. Open the cloned folder to begin your work. Inside the cloned folder, create a text file with a typing mistake in its name (for example, myfiel.txt instead of myfile.txt). Add some simple content inside the file and push it to GitHub. Now, go to your GitHub repository in a browser and check that the wrongly named file has been uploaded. Rename the file locally to the correct name. Commit the correction and push again to GitHub. Check the repository to confirm the correct file name now appears. Pull the repository again to verify the latest version is updated locally. Open the corrected file and add one line showing progress (for example, “File name corrected successfully”). Commit and push this final update to GitHub.
